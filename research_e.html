        <h3>In short...</h3>
        <p>It
        is generally accepted that many functional proteins do not have
        well-defined folded structures. These so-called intrinsically
        disordered proteins (IDPs) are encoded abundantly in the human genome
        and are involved in a variety of biological process including cell
        signalling, cell cycle control, molecular recognition, nucleic acid
        transcription and replication, as well as the development of
        neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The studies of IDPs is an
        emerging field of research and general rules for describing their
        conformational behaviour and mechanisms are still missing. Thus,
        expanding the amount of experimental data from different systems as
        well as developing new techniques to characterize their properties are
        essential to improve our knowledge about this family of proteins.</p>
        <p>We
        are interested in using the state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance
        techniques and other biophysical methods in combination with novel
        computational modelling to explore the structural propensity and
        dynamics of IDPs and the mechanism of their interaction with other
        proteins or nucleic acids at atomic resolution.</p>
  
        <h3>Intrinsically disordered proteins </h3>
        <p>After
        a decade in the post-genome era, the determination of the functions of
        proteins encoded in DNA sequences is still one of the major challenges.
        It is a widely accepted concept that the function of a protein is
        determined by its three-dimensional structure. Numerous protein
        structures with their functional interpretations deposited in the
        Protein Data Bank (PDB) over last fifty years strongly support this
        idea. However, this structure-function paradigm has been reassessed
        extensively in recent years. From bioinformatics studies, intrinsically
        disordered proteins have been shown to be amply present in all kingdoms
        of life. It is estimated that approximately 50% of mammalian proteins
        contain long disordered regions (more than 30 residues), and
        approximately 25% of their proteins are expected to be fully disordered
        under physiological conditions. The lack of folded structure provides
        several advantages such as having a larger solvent exposed surface to
        enhance the chance of interacting with binding partners via the
        so-called “fly-casting” mechanism, as well as allowing them to act as
        scaffolds by interacting with different proteins. One of the most
        intriguing aspects of disordered proteins is that they often undergo
        structural transitions from disordered to folded forms upon binding to
        their physiological partners. This folding-upon-binding mechanism opens
        a new view of protein-protein and protein-DNA/RNA interactions. In
        spite of the advantages of being unstructured, the disorderedness of
        some of these proteins also leads to disease related aggregation or
        fibrillization. It is also estimated from bioinformatics studies that
        about 80% of cancer-associated proteins contain consecutive disordered
        regions. This new class of proteins is now mostly termed intrinsically
        disordered proteins (IDPs) or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)
        of structured proteins. With those key studies elucidating the
        importance of IDPs, “protein disorder” has become an emerging research
        field. From the accumulating amount of studies, it is now generally
        believed that IDPs play key roles in many physiological processes,
        including cell signalling, cell cycle control, molecular recognition,
        nucleic acid transcription and replication, as well as in the
        development of neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases,
        amyloidoses, and type II diabetes.</p>
        <p>Physiological and
        biochemical results have drawn our attention to the importance of IDPs,
        but several aspects about the mechanisms of IDP function are still
        unknown: How are IDPs recognized by the partner proteins in the absence
        of a folded structure? Does any specific pre-recognition conformation
        exist with their flexible nature? Can we derive a general rule to
        understand the conformational behaviour of these proteins from the
        primary sequence? In other words, can we predict the functions and
        mechanisms of IDPs from primary sequence? Insights into the dynamics
        and conformational propensities of these proteins at the atomic level
        will be a critical step on the way to answer these questions.
        Conventional approaches for structure determination or characterization
        is less feasible due to the structural heterogeneity of IDPs. Novel
        biophysical methods and computational models, therefore, become
        essential to overcome their rapidly inter-converting nature. </p>
        <p>Our
        group is interested in using, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
        spectroscopy, giving specific information for almost all atoms with
        minimal interference, to characterize IDPs. Particularly, two of the
        latest developed NMR techniques, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and
        paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs), which are extremely
        sensitive to local conformational sampling and transient long-range
        interaction in unstructured proteins, will be applied to those systems
        studied. Other biophysical methods such as small angle X-ray scattering
        (SAXS), circular dichroism spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy
        will also be used as complementary methods. In addition, due to the
        heterogeneity of IDPs, a statistically significant computational model
        will be used to characterize the structural propensities of the IDPs.
        We are using experimental data as constraints to obtain representative
        conformational ensembles of IDPs. We are also developing new methods
        hopefully to predict the function of IDPs solely on the basis of
        primary sequence. We hope studies carried on in our group will improve
        our understanding of the structural dynamics, conformational behaviour,
        related biological processes, and the onset of pathological aggregation
        or fibrillization of IDPs. </p>
