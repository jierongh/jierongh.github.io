    First order of business: Introductions and reports of member societies
    <ul class="no-bullet">
      <li>
        2.1. Report from the Chinese Protein Society, Part of the Chinese Society for
        Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, by Zengyi Chang.
        <ul class="no-bullet">
          <li>2.1.1. The last meeting had approximately 500 participants.</li>
          <li>2.1.2. The Chinese government has committed a substantial investment in protein research, with the current plan running from 2008-2020, which bodes well for protein research activities and strengthening of the protein society in China.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        2.2. Malaysian report by Raja Noor Zaliha Raja Abd. Rahman: Malaysia does not
        currently have a protein society, but there are several groups conducting protein
        research, including the Enzyme and Microbial Research Center, Faculty of
        Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang,
        Selangor, Malaysia. A brochure for this center was distributed to the APPA council
        members in attendance.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.3. Indonesia Protein Society report by Bambang Sugiharto: The Indonesian Protein
        Society was started in 2006 and has had 2 national meetings. A Congress of the
        society is scheduled next. (I would appreciate it if Prof. Sugiharto can fill in the details
        here, since my notes seem to miss some points).
      </li>
      <li>
        2.4. Report on Protein Science Society of Japan (PSSJ) by Haruki Nakamura: PSSJ
        was founded in 2001, and the total member is currently more than 1000. The 13th
        annual meeting in 2013 was held in Tottori, Japan, 12-14 June, 2013, and the 14th
        annual meeting will be held in Yokohama, Japan, 25-27 June, 2014.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.5. Report on Indian Protein Society byJayant B. Udgaokar : The Indian Protein
        Society started 10-12 years ago, but has since dispersed. Due to increasing activity in
        protein research, the society is likely to be restarted soon.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.6. Report on Protein Science in Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) by Po-Huang Liang and
        Ruby Chen: Taiwan does not have an official protein society, but protein scientists are
        represented by the Taiwan Biophysical Society, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
        Society and Proteomics Society, with the Protein Society interacting with the
        Biophysical Society. In this year, in August, these societies will help host the
        International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology/Federation of Asian and
        Oceanic Biochemists and Molecular Biologists Congress in Taipei.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.7. Report on protein science in New Zealand by Kurt Krause: There are 7
        universities in New Zealand, 5 of which conduct the majority of protein research, with
        approximately 50-75 group leaders in protein research. There is no protein society for
        New Zealand, but the scientists are represented by the Biochemistry and Molecular
        Biology society and the structural biology community comprises approximately 120 people.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.8. Report on Australian protein science by Ray Norton: There is no official
        Australian protein society, but the need for communication on protein research is
        largely fulfilled by the Lorne Conference that was started in 1975 and has
        approximately 400-450 participants per year. In 2015, there will be a 40th anniversary
        meeting. Proteomics is separately represented by the Australasian Proteomics Society,
        and this and other meetings in cancer, genomics and immunology flank the Lorne
        Protein Conference each year.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.9. Report on protein science in Korea by Kyou-Hoon Han: The Protein Society of
        Korea started in 2010. There are 229 Korean participants at the current APPA meeting,
        which is a joint conference with the Korean Protein Society (Section D being the KPS meeting).
      </li>
      <li>
        2.10. Report on protein science in Singapore by Alex Law: Despite the outstanding
        achievements of the protein science community in Singapore, there is currently no
        dedicated meeting or society for protein science in Singapore.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.11. Report on protein science in Thailand by James R Ketudat-Cairns: The Protein
        Society of Thailand has an annual international symposium with approximately 200-300
        attendees. Recently, a few APPA council members have been invited to speak
        each year. This year is the 9th International Symposium of the Protein Society of
        Thailand and is being held as a joint meeting with the Asia-Oceania Human Proteome
        Organization (AOHUPO) Congress August 6-8, 2014. The meeting includes talks by
        two Nobel laureates, Ada Yonath and Kurt Wüthrich, in addition to a number of other
        outstanding plenary and invited speakers. The PST also has a Facebook page with just
        over 300 members (mostly students).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Report on the 4th APPA meeting by Young Kee Kang: A summary of the scientific
    and general program, organizing committee, budget and break-down of participants by
    country was provided on a handout by Prof. Kang. A total of 366 participants
    attended, compared to the plan for 400-450. A few other details are noted below:
    <ul class="no-bullet">
      <li>
        3.1. The number of invited speakers increased from the initial plan to the 90 invited
        and 15 orals, so the invited speakers could not be fully supported due to the budget
        limitations with this large number of speakers.
      </li>
      <li>
        3.2. Some companies provided sponsorship, but did not set up a booth, due to the cost
        of bringing representatives to Jeju to staff the booths.
      </li>
      <li>
        3.3. Korean rice cakes and doughnuts were provided in the morning and subsidized
        lunches were provided for sale at a nominal charge (3000 Won) to help make it more
        affordable for students.
      </li>
      <li>
        3.4. The photos and reports should be posted on the KPS and APPA websites.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Report on the 2017 Protein Symposium by the Protein Society (USA) and discussion
    whether to have a joint meeting with APPA.
    <ul class="no-bullet">
      <li>
        4.1. The Protein Society Council decided to hold the 2017 Protein Symposium in
        Shanghai, China in their meeting on February 1, 2014. It will be held at the Shanghai
        International Conference Center.
      </li>
      <li>
        4.2. It was asked whether the APPA should make it a joint meeting, since the APPA
        should have a meeting the same year, according to the schedule. The APPA Council
        voiced general support for the idea of a combined meeting.
      </li>
      <li>
        4.3. Ray Norton questioned how it would be organized.
        <ul class="no-bullet">
          <li>
            4.3.1. Zengyi Chang suggested having APPA sessions and overlapping sessions.
          </li>
          <li>
            4.3.2. Zengyi Chang noted the issue may be addressed at the July, 2014 Council
            meeting of the Protein Society.
          </li>
          <li>
            4.3.3 It was noted that the Protein Symposium would likely be 3-4 days and a longer
            meeting by overlapping a semi-separate meeting of the APPA would be too long for
            many participants.
          </li>
          <li>
            4.3.4. Ray Norton suggested that APPA sessions may be competing with PS speakers,
            and if they are high profile, it may be hard to compete. It was later suggested that a
            mixture of PS and APPA speakers should be included in the same sessions.
          </li>
          <li>
            4.3.5. The question was raised as to how many Americans/non-Asians are likely to
            come and suggestions of 50-100 or 100-200 were made.
          </li>
          <li>
            4.3.6. Haruki Nakamura noted that the organizing committee should include APPA
            members, including some from outside China, and Ray Norton noted this is especially
            relevant for the Program Committee.
          </li>
          <li>
            4.3.7. Yuji Goto noted that the 2015 Protein Symposium will be held in Spain and
            observing how the speakers are selected for that meeting could give us an idea how
            the Protein Society plans to proceed. He noted that the Program Committee seemed to
            consist only of scientist with positions in America.
          </li>
          <li>
            4.3.8. Kyou-Hoon Han and others suggested that we specify 50% of the Program
            Committee should be from APPA and should aim for around 50% or more speakers
            from Asia/Oceania. It was noted that this may require a larger program committee
            than the 2-3 members elected by the Protein Society Council who typically work on
            this committee. This group of 2-3 from the PS could join a larger group including
            APPA representatives and representatives of Europe or other regions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        4.4 It was expressed that the APPA should be represented in the Protein Society
        Council and that Young-Kee Kang should go to the next session as the President of
        the APPA. It was noted that the next PS Council meeting is the last one of Zengyi
        Chang’s and Haruki Nakamura’s tenures.
      </li>
      <li>
        4.5. It was expressed that the PS is basically an American organization and if they
        want to be truly international, they may need to do more than moving the Protein
        Symposium away from the USA every other year.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    President Zengyi Chang suggested the need for an additional position, such as
    “Secretary General” to work with the President of APPA on such tasks as developing
    agenda for council meetings, bylaw revisions, etc.
    <ul class="no-bullet">
      <li>
        5.1. The council generally seemed to agree that such a position was possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.2. (My personal note: “Secretary General” is the head of the U.N., so it seems a bit
        like a high position, similar to President. Maybe simply “Secretary” would be
        appropriate, since many societies have president, secretary and treasury, but the APPA
        does not have funds requiring a treasurer so far).
      </li>
      <li>
        5.3. The secretary (general) may be from another country (favored by most of the
        council, despite the possibility of less clear communication, as was noted by Ruby Chen).
      </li>
      <li>
        5.4. Job of secretary (general) is to help the president.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.5. The position should be separate from the President Elect, since the President Elect
        must organize the next meeting.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.6. Suggested duties include: Help with corporate memory and website, and manage
        the email list (or arrange for its management).
      </li>
      <li>
        5.7. A trial period was suggested for this position.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.8. Young-Kee Kang noted that it would be good to have a person younger (than
        himself, 61 years), since they need some energy for the task.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.9. The position should be added into the bylaws.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    It was noted that the renewal and replacement of council members is currently
    difficult to do with continuity, since many countries have a representative and
    associate representative that started at the same time. Also, it may be difficult to
    arrange, depending on the organization in the member countries, so the wording may
    need to be softened to allow member countries to designate as best fits their needs.
    <ul class="no-bullet">
      <li>
        6.1. Ray Norton noted that “back-up members” sounds strange, and the word
        “associate members” was suggested after some discussion.
      </li>
      <li>
        6.2. It was noted that it should be designated as one vote per country, so that the
        associate member has the right to vote in the absence of the full member.
      </li>
      <li>
        6.3. It was suggested to keep the terms for renewal flexible and allow the member
        countries to arrange it. In countries without a representative organization (Protein
        Society of the country or a BMB or Biophysical Society that is interacting with
        APPA), the current members may be allowed to suggest their replacements.
      </li>
      <li>
        6.4. It was suggested something like “it is recommended that members should serve 6
        years, but it is left to the member country to decide.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The pronunciation of “APPA” was discussed, since “appa” may be pronounced as a
    word for “sick” in Korean. It was decided that the letters may be spelled out or the
    initial A should be pronounced as a long a, “āppa” or “aipa.”
    <ul class="no-bullet">
      <li>
        7.1. I have added this to the first bylaw in the table below, but if the members think
        this is unnecessary, too long or awkward, we need not add it.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Kyou-Hoon Han suggested we should discuss producing a journal.
    <ul class="no-bullet">
      <li>
        8.1. Young Kee Kang noted that some journals by other societies, such as the Japanese
        Biophysical Society, have trouble getting paper submissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        8.2. It was noted that hiring a publishing company may increase the impact of the journal.
      </li>
      <li>
        8.3. It was suggested we could encourage members to publish in “Protein Science,”
        the journal of the Protein Society. Discussion continued to suggest we could request to
        put the APPA name on “Protein Science,” along with the Protein Society.
      </li>
      <li>
        8.4. Kyou-Hoon Han noted that it seems difficult for Asians to publish in “Protein
        Science.” There may be an attitude issue.
      </li>
      <li>
        8.5. Ray Norton noted that some prominent journals are beginning to have Chinese or
        other Asian editors, so we could request to have APPA members on the editorial board.
        Zengyi Chang and Yuji Goto noted that they are already on the “Protein Science”
        editorial board, but this primarily consists of reviewing papers.
      </li>
      <li>
        8.6. Yuji Goto noted that producing a journal brings financial responsibilities and one
        of the advantages of the APPA organization so far is the simplicity of organizing
        without financial commitments. There is no money over which to argue.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Raja Noor Zaliha Raja Abd. Rahman noted that it would be useful to have a
    letter/certificate signed by the President of APPA saying we are Council members, in
    order to fill out travel forms, apply workload and achieve recognition within our universities.
  </li>
  <li>
    It was noted that the bylaws could be amended to add promoting collaboration to our objections.
  </li>
  <li>
    Yuji Goto emphasized that the member societies should send their reports to the
    APPA website (via himself), in order to keep the webpage active. Reports including
    pictures and short descriptions with links to the member society or event websites are
    particularly encouraged.
  </li>
  <li>
    The meeting ended with a photograph session and a unanimous vote of thanks to
    Zengyi Chang for his job as president and chairing the meeting.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the course of the preceding discussions changes to the bylaws were suggested, so I
    noted my interpretations/attempts to modify these bylaws as requested below:
